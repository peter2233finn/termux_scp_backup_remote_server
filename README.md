# termux_scp_backup_remote_server

This script will backup the device's storage to a remote server using SSH and SCP. The directory structure will also be kept identical to the local device. The private key should not have a password as multiple commands will be sent.
If you have any issues with the script, feel free to fork, commit ect.
